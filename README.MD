Improved version of our famous **password generation** app! In ***GenPassX*** we added GUI, and also it offers multiple customization options and features.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
```

### Compilation
After installing the required libraries, compile the app using:

```bash
gcc -o genpassx main.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`
```

Running the Application
Once compiled, run the application with:
```bash
./genpassx
```

## Features + Guide

## Usage Tips
- **Avoid Confusing Characters:** In your password, consider replacing ambiguous characters like '0' (zero) with 'O' (letter) to avoid confusion (e.g., LEM0N vs. LEMON).
- **Password Length:** Try to use at least 12 characters for strong passwords.
- **Avoid Real Words:** Ensure your password does not contain any recognizable words for better security.
